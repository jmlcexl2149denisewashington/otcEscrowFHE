# Private Escrow Service for OTC Deals

This project is designed as a fully decentralized escrow service for over-the-counter (OTC) deals, leveraging **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption technology** to ensure the utmost privacy and security in financial transactions. By encrypting the transaction details, prices, and identities of the parties involved, this service guarantees that assets are only transferred when cryptographic settlement conditions are met, making it an essential tool for large-scale P2P transactions in the decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape.

## Why This Matters

In the rapidly evolving world of DeFi, OTC trading has become increasingly popular for high-value transactions. However, participants often face risks surrounding privacy and security. Traditional escrow services lack the necessary safeguards, exposing sensitive transaction details to potential breaches. This project addresses these concerns by providing a secure and private solution that upholds the integrity of the transaction while allowing parties to conduct trades with confidence.

## How FHE Provides a Solution

The Private Escrow Service utilizes **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)** to enable secure computation on encrypted data. Zama's open-source libraries, such as **Concrete** and the **zama-fhe SDK**, empower this technology by allowing smart contracts to execute trading conditions homomorphically. This means that sensitive information remains encrypted throughout the process, ensuring that no unauthorized party can access it, while still enabling automatic asset transfers upon meeting the stipulated terms. By employing this approach, the project sets a new standard for security and privacy in financial transactions.

## Key Features

- **FHE-Encrypted Transaction Terms:** All details regarding the transaction, including terms and identities, are encrypted, safeguarding privacy.
- **Automated Settlement via Smart Contracts:** Smart contracts handle escrow and settlement autonomously, ensuring accurate execution based on pre-defined conditions.
- **Enhanced Security for Large P2P Trades:** The project provides top-tier privacy protection, fostering trust in large-scale peer-to-peer transactions.
- **Structured Trade Setup and Status Tracking:** Users can easily set up transactions and monitor their status through an intuitive interface.

## Technology Stack

- **Zama SDKs:** Leveraging Zama’s **zama-fhe SDK** for confidential computing.
- **Solidity:** For smart contract development.
- **Node.js:** For backend functionality and server-side scripting.
- **Hardhat/Foundry:** Development environment for compiling and testing Ethereum smart contracts.

## Installation Instructions

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Ensure that you have Node.js installed** on your machine. You can download it from the official Node.js website.
2. **Install Hardhat or Foundry** based on your preference for Ethereum smart contract development.
3. **Download the project files** directly to your local environment.
4. Open your terminal and navigate to the project folder.
5. Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies, including Zama’s libraries:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

**Please do not use `git clone` or any URLs to download the files.**

## Build & Run Instructions

To compile and test the smart contracts, follow these commands within the project directory:

1. **Compile the smart contracts**:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

2. **Run the tests to ensure everything is functioning as expected**:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat test
   ```

3. **Deploy the smart contract to your selected network (e.g., local test network)**:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
   ```

### Example Code Snippet

Here’s a simple example showing how to create an escrow transaction using the deployed smart contract:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "./otcEscrowFHE.sol";

contract ExampleUsage {
    otcEscrowFHE public escrow;

    constructor(address _escrowAddress) {
        escrow = otcEscrowFHE(_escrowAddress);
    }

    function createEscrowDeal(address buyer, address seller, uint256 amount, bytes32 terms) public {
        escrow.createDeal(buyer, seller, amount, terms);
    }
}
```
